This is the code repository for [Mastering Grunt [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-grunt-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785281617), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Grunt is everywhere. JavaScript projects from jQuery to Twitter Bootstrap use Grunt to convert code, run tests, and produce distributions for production. Grunt is basically a build automation tool. This video will be an advanced practical guide that will help the users to dive deep into efficiently creating and maintaining large scale tasks and project builds, automate work-flows of large groups by creating complex routines, integrating third party plugins and creating custom tasks. Hence this video is effectively about managing a complex web application by using the build automation tool grunt.

This video will start with advanced configuration and customization of the grunt environment. This part will focus on practical examples on how to create a customized Grunt environment that will support large scale web development. Next, with the help of hands-on examples, the users will learn about topics like CSS linting, combination, compilation and minification; JavaScript linting, AMD modules, and templates; image processing and optimizing; and creating a local server.

The video will then move on to more advanced topics like LiveReload, Test Automation, Modular configuration, and combining tasks. It will talk about how to scaffold plugins using Grunt init and Yeoman, how to test them with Mocha and Chai, and how to publish them so others can use them. Finally the video will conclude with a dedicated best practices and troubleshooting section.
